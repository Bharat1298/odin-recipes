        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        There's lots of info out there on how to cook rice — perhaps because it's such a simple and inexpensive staple. 
        But the back of the rice package says one thing about how to cook it, and your favorite blog says something else. 
        Good news — you've landed on our tried-and-tested guide. We'll walk you through all the different ways to make different varieties of rice, 
        and ensure it never comes out mushy, gummy, or burnt.
